🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Interactive Olympics 2024 Dashboard! 🏅



I just completed an in-depth Power BI dashboard that analyzes the 2024 Olympics data. This dashboard covers key areas such as:



Top-performing countries by medal count

Gender representation in the competition

Historical medal trends across different Olympics years

Country-wise breakdown of athletes, including age groups and achievements

🔑 Key Insights:



11,110 athletes participated, with a nearly even split between male (5,655) and female (5,455) competitors.

The United States topped the leaderboard with the highest medal count.

Gender breakdown: Males won 368 gold medals, while females won 363 gold medals.

A historical view of medals awarded over the years shows significant trends across countries and time.

This project helped me sharpen my data visualization, storytelling, and dashboarding skills using Power BI. Special thanks to The Developer  for the invaluable guidance and support in bringing this project to life!



Feel free to check out the dashboard and share your feedback. 🙌
